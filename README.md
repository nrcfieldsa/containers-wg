# containers-wg proposal
containers-wg proposal prepared for SC23 and NIST 2nd International Workshop on FAIR Containerized Computational Software 2023

KEYWORDS: "container specification", "standard", OCI, labelling, metadata, annotation, "container image", compatibility, attestation, security

OBJECTIVE: Proposal for container metadata standardization, enumerate common fields and build a usage case.

GOALS
--
 1. Outline usage case for metadata with containers at NRC
 2. Propose a common set of fields for inclusion in standard
 3. Propose mechanism for handling domain-specific metadata field-sets

IMPLEMENTATION TARGETS
--
 - At this phase no implementation targets have been planned by NRC. This is exploratory work only.
 - The first step of this excercise is to outline a light-weight proposal for standards discussion.
 - It would then be possible to use a very basic stub OCI annotation handler, extended to test proposed new metadata fields and external schema (namespace and plugin) support.
   - To include expamples of how to get an set the annotations and display a summary using demo OCI image.
   - Otherwise, if other code bases are already implementing - check if this guidance is workable using those implementations.
 - External schema references should be cached on first build, or upon container update with the schema version number listed.
